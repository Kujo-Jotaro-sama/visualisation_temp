        While Brownian motion is famous for its versatility (it can be used in thermodynamics to model suspended particle motion in a fluid, in quantum mechanics to form the theoretical basis of the path integral (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman%E2%80%93Kac_formula' target='_blank'>Feynman-Kac formula</a>), and in mathematical theory of finance to model pricing fluctuations over time (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model' target='_blank'>Black-Scholes model</a>)), it is only a special case of the more general Lévy process.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Lévy process X(t) must satisfy the following 4 conditions:<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>\(X(0) = 0\);</li>
        <li>Independence of increments: for any \(0 \leqslant t_1 < t_2 < \dots < t_n < \infty\), \(X(t_2)-X(t_1), X(t_3)-X(t_2), \dots, X(t_n)-X(t_{n-1})\) are independent;</li>
        <li>Stationary increments: for any \(s < t\), \(X(t)-X(s)\) is equal in distribution to \(X(t-s)\);</li>
        <li>Continuity in probability: for any \(\epsilon > 0\) and \(t > 0\) it holds that \(\lim_{h\to0} P(|X(t+h) - X(t)| > \epsilon) = 0 \).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        While Condition 1 is a trivial initial condition, Condition 2 a constraint necessary to ensure the motion is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain' target='_blank'>Markov (or memoryless) process</a>, and Condition 4 states that there must not be any jumps or gaps in the time evolution of the probability density function, Condition 3 contains the most information as it restricts our pdf's of choice to that of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution' target='_blank'>stable distributions</a>, i.e. distributions which retain its properties under linear combination with a member of its own family.\(^{*}\)<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a> 
    </p>

    <p>
        In this page we will be focusing on a specific construct of the Lévy process called the Lévy flight, which was first introduced by the French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in his 1982 book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature".<a href='#cite2'>[2]</a> In this book, Mandelbrot proposed the Lévy walk object as a candidate model for galaxy clusters, and he used an isotropic walk with a Pareto step-width distribution defined as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
        $$f(x) = \bigg\{^{0 : x < 1}_{Dx^{-(D+1)} : x \geqslant 1}$$
    </p>

    <p>
        where D is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Role_of_scaling' target='_blank'>fractal dimension</a> of the resultant random walk object (not to be confused with the coefficient of diffusion D), and is restricted to take values \(0 < D < 2\) to ensure the stability of the random variable. This choice of range is incidentally the same as the choice of range on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution', target='_blank'>\(\alpha\) parameter</a> of a distribution, which is what mathematically defines a stable distribution. The stability of a function is a whole other topic worthy of its own visualisation. In this visualisation We will gloss over it, and leave it as an open question for the most daring to ponder: what makes D the equivalent of \(\alpha\) in this distribution? (hint: Gnedenko and Kolmogorov's generalised central limit theorem).
    </p>

    <p>
        As can be seen from our model on the right, the Lévy flight object behaves completely differently from the Brownian motion. Compared to Brownian motion, the Lévy flight is more prone to take big jumps due to its power-like instead of exponential-like tail. This means that while it is not the most likely for a Lévy walker to take big steps, the probability of the walk object landing in the tail is not negligibly small. Hence, for the right choice of D parameter, we can obtain a walk object clustered in little groups, with clear divisions amongst them. And the closer the value of D is to 0, the more dramatic the big jumps are, and the more defined the divisions are. On the other hand, the user might be surprised to find that the closer the D value is to 2, the more the walk object resembles the classic Brownian motion. This is again tied into the \(\alpha\) parameter of distributions (incidentally the \(\alpha\) parameter of a normal distribution is equal to 2).
    </p>

    <p>
        While the Lévy flight certainly is a bizarre and curious object, it can actually be found quite often in the natural world. Many biologists have discovered that certain organisms under certain conditions follow the Lévy flight, prompting many to believe the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis, stating that "organisms adapt the Brownian motion when there is an abundance of food, and the Lévy flight when there is a scarcity of food".<a href='#cite3'>[3]</a> This hypothesis agrees with our intuition as when there is a scarcity of food, an efficient way of foraging is to hover around a region for some time, and then concluding there is no food in a region, rush to the next for the same foraging process. Theoretically it has been shown that the Lévy flight, indeed, yields maximum searching efficiency under certain circumstances.<a href='#cite4'>[4]</a> In physics, the Lévy flight can be found in diffusion at liquid-solid interfaces.<a href='#cite5'>[5]</a> In fact, Lévy flight might not be as alien as we think. It could have been one of the natural random walks that have always escaped our notice until recently. An intersting observation made by Mandelbrot states that the Lévy flight is the zeroset of a 3 dimensional Brownian motion. Incidentally, the first hitting time of a 1-D Brownian motion (topological dimension), also follows the Lévy distribution.<a href='#cite6'>[6]</a>

        To learn more about the Lévy flight and Lévy process, it is recommended to peruse Mandelbrot's original text "The Fractal Geometry of Nature", which can be accessed <a href='https://library-search.imperial.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44IMP_ALMA_DS2145740540001591&context=L&vid=ICL_VU1&lang=en_US&search_scope=LRSCOP_44IMP&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=all&query=any,contains,fractal%20geometry%20of%20nature&mode=Basic' target='_blank'>at the Central Library, level 2</a>.
