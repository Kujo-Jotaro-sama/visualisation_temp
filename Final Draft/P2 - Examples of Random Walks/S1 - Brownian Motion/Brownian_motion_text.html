        This is perhaps the random walk\(^{*}\) model that physicists use (and overuse) the most. While the walk was discovered by the English botanist Robert Brown as early as in 1827<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a>, a good enough mathematical model (for this seemingly erratic motion) did not come along until a certain German patent clerk named Albert Einstein took a crack at it. In his 1905 paper "Investigations on the Theory of Brownian Movements"<a href='#cite2'>[2]</a>, Einstein proposed that the random motion of large particles in fluids is due to the thermal motion of molecules, and worked out the probability density function of the position of a single particle to be:
    </p>

    <p>
        $$f(x,t) = \frac{n}{\sqrt{4\pi D}}\frac{e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}}{\sqrt{t}}$$
    </p>

    <p>
        where n is the number of suspended particles in the fluid, D the coefficient of diffusion, t the time after a certain measurement of x has been made. As can be seen from the equation, the position of the particle follows a normal distribution with its standard deviation increasing with the square root of t. By substituting t with and infinitesimal division of time \(\delta\)t, we know that after discretising the time domain of the Brownian motion\(^{\dagger}\), the width of the flight for each individual steps also follow a normal distribution. We utilised this idea to build the visualisation of Brownian motion on the right. 
    </p>

        Graph illustration: This is a visualisation of the Brownian motion. In our simulation, because we can only do calculations for discretised time domain, the individual time steps is fixed by our program and chosen to be as small as computationally efficient. The slider below allows you to twerk the standard deviation of the probability density function. Try thinking of it as twerking the coefficient of diffusion of the fluid, which depends of external conditions such as temperature, viscosity, pressure, etc.

            <li>\(^{*}\)Strictly speaking Brownian motion, due to its continuous nature, cannot be considered a random walk process. A random walk object must be discrete in both space and time. However, due to the fact that modern physicists usually use computer programmes to build their models, which require discretisation on the temporal and spatial domains, the concensus has become less strict and it is not uncommon for physicists and scientists in general to refer to the discretised version of Brownian motion as Brownian motion itself. <a href='#cite3'>[3]</a></li>
            <li>\(^{\dagger}\)This becomes a process that the French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot refers to as the Rayleigh flight.<a href='#cite4'>[4]</a></li>
