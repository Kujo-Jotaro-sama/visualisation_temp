        The random walk is one of the most fundamental and far-reaching kinds of stochastic processes. The stochastic process is a fancy word for the random process, which is essentially the time evolution of a random variable X (denoted as X(t)).<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a> For example, the fluctuation of tomato prices in Tesco is a stochastic process, so is the variation of prices on the stock exchange, or the time evolution of Lagrangian data from the oceans.<a href='#cite2'>[2]</a> Nearly everything we measure over time is a stochastic process\(^{*}\), and therefore it is important for physicists to understand what they are and how we should work with them. This visualisation focuses on the time evolution of a random variable ï¼ˆusually position) on some mathematical space (usually \(\mathbb{Z}^n\)), the random walk. By the end of this visualisation, the user should take away some introductory level of knowledge and appreciation for the random walk object, as well as how it is now being applied in many physical fields.

        Graph illustration: This graph describes one of the most basic types of the random walk - the Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli' target="_blank">the elder brother</a>). Consider a coin flip trial. When the coin lands on heads, the object moves forward by 1 increment; when the coin lands of tails, it moves backwards by 1 increment. In the jargon of statistics this is essentially a random walk on the integer number line. The Bernoulli process in its more general form (in which the mathematical space becomes two-dimensional and continuous and the time domain becomes continuous, while the step size follow a normal distribution that gets broader over time instead of being fixed) is often used to describe particle motion in a fluid. This is known as the Brownian motion.<a href='#cite3'>[3]</a>

            <li>\(^{*}\)It is the general consensus among physicists that even what is usually considered a deterministic process, e.g. the position of an apple under free fall, can be modelled as a stochastic process, only with the range of its random variation close to zero.</li>
