# visualisation_temp
This is a temporary repository for Chi's visualisation on random walks.

Originally I have set out to build four pages instead of the two pages I have here right now. Due to time constraint my supervisor and I decided to upload the two pages (introduction & examples) that we believe are more or less done now, and then work on the remaing two pages (which are not the most important part of this visualisation) over the Christimas holiday.

All html files and scripts are contained in the "Final Draft" folder. I did not yet attempt any styling on my own, as I was informed there will be a specialised team building a new template for it. Therefore I simply used the old css skeleton I found from previous visualisations.

Also note that I do not yet know how to set up with navigators properly. From what I have heard from Vedant, the new template will have a new way of going from page to page. Therefore I simply filled in the name of the webpages without setting up the navigators properly. (If you clikc the navigators on the left side of the webpage it would not work).

Also as I have gathered for the new css stylesheet to work each webpage needs to be broken down into 2 html files, one contaning the textual contents while the other the interactive bits. Therefore, in which folder there are two html files corresponding to the texts and the graphics respectively.

Thank you for reviewing my visualisation. If there are any mistakes, typos, bugs, possible improvements, etc., please do not hesitate to tell me.
